Syscoin Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
Syscoin Core is the original Syscoin client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of Syscoin transactions, which requires a few hundred gigabytes of disk space. Depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download Syscoin Core, visit [syscoincore.org](https://syscoincore.org/en/download/).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Syscoin Core on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/syscoin-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/syscoind` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run syscoin-qt.exe.

### macOS

Drag Syscoin Core to your applications folder, and then run Syscoin Core.
